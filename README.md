####**Three Tips from Scott**

**1)** If you are going to "float" an element, you need to make sure that all of the children elements are floated as well.

**2)** Speaking of float, "overflow:hidden" needs to be applied to the parent elelement. Otherwise the children elements which are floating are going to collapse onto themselves.

**3)** The biggest "_Ah-ha!_" moment for me of the past week was learning that ccoding is boxes within boxes. Inside the body is the main. Inside of that could be a section, then divs, then anchor tags, etc. Keeping and organized flow and reducing clutter will help eveything move along smoothly. Also, it helps to have intelligent reference names for your CSS classes. Creative names, for example pertaining to superheroes, might be fun but makes for an unprofessional looking site and makes things hard to find.
